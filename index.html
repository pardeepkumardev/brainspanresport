		<h3>YOUR OMEGA-3 INDEX:</h3>
		<p>The human brain is nearly 60 percent fat with the majority being Omega-3 fatty acids. These are the building blocks of the brain and are crucial molecules that determine the brain's integrity and ability to perform. Omega-3s canoot be made by your body, so it is critical to obtain them by eating fish or taking fish oil. However, when it comes to Omega-3s, the most important factor is how uch is being absorbed by your blood cells.</p>

		<p>Consistently measuring your Omega-3 Index is the only way to maintain optimal levels. An Omega-3 Index over 8% is associated with improved memory, attention, learning, mood staibility, faster recovery from consussion as well as lower anxiety, depression, and inflammation. Additionaly, tracking your Omega-3 Index over time is one of the most important ways to help prevent alzheimer's disease, cognitive decline, and  cardiovascular disease. Omega-3s are to your brain cells what calcium is to your bones; or what protein is to your muscles.</p>

		<h3>RESEARCH &amp; ASSOCIATED CONDITIONS:</h3>
		<p>The graph below shows how your Omega-3 Index compares to current research to current research studies.</p>

			<h3>PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS:</h3>
			<p>To achieve an Omega-3 Index in the optimal green zone in 3 months, you will need to do one of the following:</p>

		<div class="rb_body">
			<div class="feature_wrap">
				<div class="feature_item">
					<img src="img/fish_ico.png" alt="">
					<h4>Eat a 3 oz. serving of oily fish (Salmon, Herring, Bluefin) at least 11 times per week</h4>
				</div>
				<div class="feature_item">
					<img src="img/bottle_ico.png" alt="">
					<h4>Take a high quality Omega-3 supplement with 2,500 milligrams of combined EPA &amp; DHA per day</h4>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Ask your doctor to recommend a quality Omega-3 supplement that has demonstrated a high level of cellular absorption. The most important factor is how much EPA and DHA is absorbed into your blood cells. How it gets there (fish or supplements) really doesn't matter, as long as its absorbed. ONLY choose hight quality Omega-3 supplements with both EPA &amp; DHA (from fish). Omega-3 supplements with ALA (from plants) will have little effect improving your cell health or your Omega-3 Index. See Appendix Aof this report for information on how to choose quality Omega-3 supplements.</p>
